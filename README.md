Papaya is an open source GPU-powered image editor built using C++ and OpenGL.

Papaya is designed to be fast. It starts up quickly, and is already [noticeably faster](http://thegamecoder.com/building-a-fast-modern-image-editor/) than other popular editors at zooming, panning and brush rendering.

Papaya is very much a work in progress, and is not ready for real world usage. For development updates, you can follow [@PapayaEditor](https://twitter.com/PapayaEditor) on Twitter.

Building
--------

Papaya currently supports Windows, and a Linux port is on its way.

It is set up to use single file compilation. Compile only win32_papaya.cpp, and you're done.
